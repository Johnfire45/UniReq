# UniReq - HTTP Request Deduplicator for Burp Suite

**Author: Harshit Shah**

A Burp Suite extension that filters duplicate HTTP requests by computing unique fingerprints based on request structure and content. Built using Java and the Montoya API with a clean, modular architecture featuring proper separation of concerns and enhanced user experience.

## üéØ Purpose

UniReq helps security testers and developers by:
- **Reducing noise** in HTTP history by filtering duplicate requests
- **Improving efficiency** during manual testing and automated scanning
- **Providing visibility** into request patterns and duplication statistics
- **Maintaining performance** through intelligent fingerprinting algorithms
- **Ensuring code quality** with modular architecture and type-safe data models
- **Enhancing user experience** with smart controls and professional interface

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Fingerprinting**: Computes unique fingerprints using `METHOD | NORMALIZED_PATH | HASH(CONTENT)`
- **Thread-Safe Operation**: Uses concurrent collections for safe multi-threaded operation
- **Flexible Filtering**: Toggle filtering on/off without losing stored fingerprints
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Live updates of request counts and duplication metrics
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated model classes

### Enhanced User Interface
- **Smart Export Controls**: Export button automatically disabled when no data available
- **Context-Aware Tooltips**: Dynamic tooltips showing request counts and availability status
- **Target Host Display**: Shows target host information above response viewer
- **Read-Only Editors**: Prevents accidental modifications while maintaining full functionality
- **Professional Layout**: Consistent spacing and alignment throughout the interface
- **Full Path Feedback**: Export success messages display complete file paths

### Fingerprint Algorithm
- **HTTP Method**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **Normalized Path**: Lowercased with trailing slashes removed
- **Content Hash**: SHA-256 of request body (POST/PUT) or query string (GET)
- **Examples**:
  - `GET | /api/users | EMPTY`
  - `POST | /api/login | a1b2c3d4e5f6...` (SHA-256 of body)
  - `GET | /search | e5f6g7h8i9j0...` (SHA-256 of query string)

### User Interface
- **Dedicated Tab**: Clean, organized interface in Burp's main window
- **Control Panel**: Enable/disable filtering, clear fingerprints, refresh stats
- **Export Panel**: Smart export controls with format selection and state management
- **Statistics Display**: Real-time counters with color-coded indicators
- **Status Monitoring**: Current filtering state and system status

- **Blocking Mode**: Duplicates can be dropped entirely (available in code)

### Memory Management
- Fingerprints are stored in memory only (not persisted)
- Use "Clear Fingerprints" to free memory when needed
- Extension automatically cleans up on unload

### Security Considerations
- **No Sensitive Data Logging**: Request content is hashed, not stored
- **In-Memory Only**: No data persisted to disk
- **Safe Logging**: Only non-sensitive request metadata is logged
- **Read-Only Editors**: Prevents accidental modifications to request/response data

- Review extension error logs in Burp's output

#### No Statistics Updates
- Ensure proxy is active and intercepting traffic
- Check if filtering is enabled in the UniReq tab
- Try manually refreshing statistics

#### Export Button Disabled
- Check if any requests are available in the table
- Export button automatically disables when no data is present
- Hover over the button to see tooltip explaining the state

#### High Memory Usage
- Clear fingerprints periodically during long sessions
- Monitor stored fingerprint count
- Consider restarting the extension for memory cleanup

### Debug Information
